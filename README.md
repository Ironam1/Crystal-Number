# Crystal Game

This game is deployed and can be found here: https://ironam1.github.io/Crystal-Number/

The problem:

Use JQuery to create a number guessing game. Use HTML and CSS to
create a web application for users to play the game.

Solution:

When the application loads, a random target number will be generated. Four crystals will have random values assigned to them. User must match their score with the target score without going over. Click on each crystal to figure its value. An alert will display to let the user know if they won or lost. Wins and losses will be tallied for the user and the game will refresh without page reloading.
