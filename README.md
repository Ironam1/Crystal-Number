# unit-4-game

This game is deployed and can be found here: https://ironam1.github.io/Crystal-Number/

This is a number guessing game I created. When the user runs the application, a random target number will be generated. There are 4 crystals, each with random number values assigned to them at the start of the game. The user will click on one of the crystals to find the value associated with the crystal. Each click will add to the user total. The user must match the target number, without going over. There is a counter to track the total wins and losses for each session.
